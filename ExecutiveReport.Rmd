# Background

## What is League of Legends?

>- A free-to-play, multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) videogame
>- Developed and published by Riot Games
>- ~100 million active players a month
>- ~100k viewers during peak hours on Twitch.tv
>- Active and popular professional eSports scene
>- Numerous 3rd party websites and books on gameplay strategies

## How is League of Legends Played?

<img src="img/rift-map.jpg" height=328.3px width=400px>

>- Primary mode: Summoner's Rift
>- 5 vs. 5 human players, plus AI minions for each team
>- Main objective: destroy enemy's base (aka The Nexus)
>- Sub-objectives: destroy enemy's defense turrents
>- Key objectives: slay dragons and Baron Nashor for boosts

## How is League of Legends Played?

<img src="img/champions.jpg" height=235.6px width=468px>

>- Players select 1 of 141 champions to represent them
>- Each champion has unique set of attributes and abilities
>- Gain power by accumulating: XP to level up, and gold to buy enhancement items
>- Accumulate XP/gold by killing minions, monsters, and enemy players, and taking objectives
>- Killed players must wait before respawn

# Team Roles

## What are Team Roles?

<img class="img-subtitle" src="img/top-icon.png"><img class="img-subtitle" src="img/jungle-icon.png"><img class="img-subtitle" src="img/mid-icon.png"><img class="img-subtitle" src="img/bot-icon.png"><img class="img-subtitle" src="img/support-icon.png">

>- In standard team composition, each player is designated one of fives roles based on:
>- Their champion's attributes and abilities
>- Their intended location on the map near start of a match (around 1:25-1:30) -- called the laning phase
>- The Roles: Top Laner, Jungler, Mid Laner, Botlane Carry, Support

## <img class="img-subtitle" src="img/top-icon.png"> Top Laner

<img src="img/rift-map.jpg" height=328.3px width=400px>

- Fights in the top lane of the map during laning phase
- Key attributes/responsibilities: front line tankiness, deal moderate-to-high damage, ability to safely initiate team fights

## <img class="img-subtitle" src="img/jungle-icon.png"> Jungler

<img src="img/rift-map.jpg" height=328.3px width=400px>

- Fights in the jungle areas of the map during laning phase
- Key attributes/responsibilities: ability to efficiently kill most jungle monsters during laning phase, provide ganks for in-lane teammates, place wards on map
- Can deal high burst damage to neutral monsters via Smite

## <img class="img-subtitle" src="img/mid-icon.png"> Mid Laner

<img src="img/rift-map.jpg" height=328.3px width=400px>

- Fights in the middle lane of the map during laning phase
- Key attribute/responsibility: deal high burst, ability power-based damage
- Champion is usually a mage or an assassin

## <img class="img-subtitle" src="img/bot-icon.png"> Botlane Carry 

<img src="img/rift-map.jpg" height=328.3px width=400px>

- Fights in the bottom lane of the map during laning phase
- Key attributes/responsibilities: back line squishiness, deal high sustained attack damage, be the highest damage dealer in match
- Champion is usually ranged (e.g., guns, arrows, etc.)

## <img class="img-subtitle" src="img/support-icon.png"> Support

<img src="img/rift-map.jpg" height=328.3px width=400px>

- Fights/assists in the bottom lane of the map during laning phase
- Key attributes/responsibilities: help Botlane Carry survive and achieve kills, provide healing, shielding, and/or other utilities during team fights, place wards on map

# The Problem

## The Problem

>- Humanly impossible to visually observe every match and record team roles manually.
>- ***Can we use match data and machine learning to distinguish all five team roles from each other?***

## Team Roles -- Match Overview, Draft Pick Format

RedTeam <- c(6,7,8,9,10)

# The Data

## Data Overview

<img class="img-league-logo" src="img/nalcs-logo.png"><img class="img-league-logo" src="img/eulcs-logo.png"><img class="img-league-logo" src="img/lck-logo.png"><img class="img-league-logo" src="img/lms-logo.png"><img class="img-league-logo" src="img/msi-logo.png">

>- Data for all matches in the 2018 Spring Split seasons of the North America LoL Championship Series (NALCS), the Europe LoL Championship Series (EULCS), LoL Champions Korea (LCK), and LoL Master Series (LMS), plus the 2018 Mid-Season Invitational (MSI)
>- Each match data accessed using API domain https://acs.leagueoflegends.com/v1/stats/game/


## Obtaining API and Match IDs

## Sample Collection of Match IDs

kable(head(read.csv("gameid_data/NALCS_Spring2018.csv")) %>% select(c(1:5)), caption = "Match ID Data, First Six Matches of NA LCS 2018 Spring Split")
```

## Cleaning Each Match for Player Stats

>- JSON response object contains two sub-objects (```participants``` and ```participantIdentities```) that contain indvidual player stats
>- ```participantIdentities``` contains 10 players' usernames under sub-object ```player```
>- ```participants``` contains two more sub-objects (```stats``` and ```timeline```)
>- basically, ```participants``` is flattened out, then joined with ```player```
>- final product for single match is 10 rows and  nearly 150 columns/variables
>- process repeated for all other matches, and tables are concatenated together 

## Synopsis of Match Player Datasets

- NA LCS: 117 matches, 1170 observations
- EU LCS: 115 matches, 1150 observations
- LCK: 246 matches, 2460 observations
- LMS: 144 matches, 1440 observations
- MSI: 74 matches, 740 observations

## Sample of MSI 2018 Match Player Dataset

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

kable(sample_n(read.csv("datasets/msi/msi_2018_match_player_stats.csv"), 12) %>% select(c(summonerName,kills,deaths,assists,totalDamageTaken)))
```

## Creating Player Per-Match Average Datasets

>- Observations from the match player datasets are grouped together by team, player name, and then assumed team role
>- Each group's variables' statistics are calculated to mean (average) values.

## Machine Learning Approach

1. Put together all five datasets for player per-match averages, then split the entire set into two subsets: one for training and one for testing.
2. Create/train a model using the **k-means** clustering algorithm on the training set.  Since we already know how many team roles exist, we set ```k=5```.
3. Test/validate the model using the **k-nearest-neighbor (knn)** classification algorithm on the testing set.  Since there are only five possible neighbors, and we want to classify each observation to exactly one group (team role), we set ```k=1```.

## Machine Learning Approach (continued)

4. Put together all five datasets for single match player stats.
5. Test the model using **knn** on the new dataset.
6. Evaluate performance of Steps 2, 3, and 5 using a **confusion matrix**.

Note: features are scaled using **z-score**.

# Conclusion

## Summary

>- 21 out of ~150 variables were chosen for model's feature set
>- **k-means** clustering on per-match averages training set was 100% accurate
>- Used centroids produced from clustering as the model for validation and testing sets
>- Model used for **knn** classification on per-match averages validation set was 100% accurate
>- Used same model on "real world" single match performances test set
>- **knn** classification on test set was 94.7% accurate

## Caveats / Limitations

>- Sample size vs. population
>- Patches ==> possible meta changes
>- Normal / Blind Pick / vs. AI modes are lower stakes
>- Unique champions (e.g. Vladimir, Swain, Gangplank, Ivern)
>- Varying levels of competition

# The Future and Recommendations

## The Future and Recommendations

>- Larger datasets: virtually endless number of non-custom matches can be accessed off of one username alone due to recursive nature of accessing match history.
>- Additional data (i.e., the ```timeline``` API using match IDs)
>- Alternative k-means training
>- Creating models per division
>- Creating models per patch

## Final Thoughts

>- Draft Pick game modes allow safe assumptions on team roles
>- Limits the number of matches analytics sites can use for analyzing champion and team role performances
>- While not absolutely perfect, model could provide excellent tool for classifying team roles in Blind Pick Summoner's Rift game modes,where team roles cannot be assumed based on Participant ID alone.
